# Automail
An enhancement collection for anilist.co

When installed, a list of options in https://anilist.co/settings/apps can be used to configure the behaviour of the website

Automail primarily deals with:
- Notifications
- Statistics
- Styling
- Activity navigation

# Available releases

As a userscript: https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/370473-automail  
As a Firefox addon: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/automail/

Which one should you use? The userscript is rolling release, so you get new features immediately. There might be some bugs here and there, as they haven't been tested much. The firefox addon is updated every couple of months. It's intended to be more stable, and tries to meet the minimum security standards of mozilla. It is however often slightly outdated.

# Build from source

"src/" contains a makefile, run "make" there.
Requires make, m4 and basic shell utilities

Will build the userscript and the firefox addon in src/build/
