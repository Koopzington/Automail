The "create" function
Used to create new DOM elements
documented in /src/utilities.js

graphql.js contains some important functions for interacting with the Anilist API

The automailAPI

Behind a setting (turned off by default), users can enable API to controll Automail.

This is in the form of an object that belongs to the document object.
	
	document.automailAPI

This exposes some functions of Automail to any other script. The goal being to either simplify writing of third-party script, or make it easier for such scripts to adapt to the changes Automail does.

This is not a security vulnerability, as these permissions are available in any case to scripts a user decides to run. It just makes it easier for those scripts.

Current interfaces:

	automailAPI.automailAPI
		-- an object containing various info about the version of Automail running. Can be found in src/scriptInfo.js
	automailAPI.generalAPIcall
	automailAPI.authAPIcall
	automailAPI.queryPacker
		-- implements an interface to the Anilist Graphql API.
		-- their implementation can be found in src/graphql.js
	automailAPI.settings
		-- an object containing the user's script settings
	automailAPI.logOut
		-- a function to make Automail forget its access token
		-- the access token is still valid, and must be retracted from the apps permission page if you want to disable it entirely

All raw HTML (avoid if possible) must be sanitised.
Do:
DOMPurify.sanitize(yourHTML)
