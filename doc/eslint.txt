Eslint is a tool to detect style and code mistakes.
This is optional, and not required for building nor contributing to Automail. (It can however save you some time)

How to use:

    Install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/) LTS for your platform
    Open terminal and enter the Automail directory
    Run npm install
    Run npm run lint to lint all JS project files
        Or npm run lint-build to lint just the compiled userscript

Installing globally (alternative):
Follow the same steps as above, except replace step 3 with:

    Run npm install -g eslint@8 eslint-plugin-compat@4

Optional:

    Install an integration (https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations#editors) for your code editor
        will apply linting as you edit open files instead of needing to run the terminal command
