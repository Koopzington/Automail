A somewhat unimportant system that's implemented in the script, which allows for making adjustments to the stats generated.

It works by including a JSON object to the list notes of an entry, surounded by $-signs

Implements the following keys:

"adjust": takes a number, representing the number of episodes to add/remove for the show's duration.
"more": takes an array of episode numbers, or a string specifying extra episodes watched.
"skip": same as more, except it represents filler
	String syntax:
	comma separated, each enty bein either:
		a number, representing an episode
		number dash number, representing a range (like 4-8)
	both episode numbers and ranges can have an "x" multiplier after them

	valid eamples:
	[1,3,"1-4"]
	"1,2,3"
	"1-3"
	"4,7x5,1-3x4"


Implemented in the function "parseListJSON"


Other list note stuff:

#tag <- this is a custom tag, which shows up in your "more stats" section, and in an index on your list

##STRICT <- a special tag, used to turn off various functions fixing "sloppy" tag formatting and casing errors
