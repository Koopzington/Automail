--- new way:

Follow the template in src/HOWTO.css, insert your css in the css field, and save in /src/modules/yourModule.js

--- old way:

1. Add a boolean in useScripts, in settings.js

2. Link your boolean in useScriptsDefinitions, in controller.js

3. Inline you insertion in conditionalStyles.js

4. (optional) split it into its own file in the css directory, linking it by m4 from conditionalStyles.js
