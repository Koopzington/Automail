"remind hoh to update the commonUnfinishedManga list"
	/src/data/commonUnfinishedManga.json contains a mini-database of unfinished manga.
	edit the timestamp in /src/utilities.js to make it stop nagging

How do I publish the firefox addon?
	You have to register a firefox account, and publish it separately.
	The existing firefox addon is currently not kept up to date

sequels.json, sequels_manga.json
	These are also databases, and must manually be kept up to date.
	/src/data/sequel_scripts has some code, were you run the calli() function with page numbers (wait some time, or get throttled) until the entire database is scanned.
	Then merge this somehow. Be aware of special cases in sequels_special_cases.txt

If hoh can't be reached, ask synthtech about the architecture of the script
