The English language file does not contain keys of the form "$role_something".
These are used on staff pages to translate roles, but since those are already in English, there's no need to translate them into English.
But if you want those roles translated into your language, you need to add keys like "$role_Story & Art" and "$role_Director".
There's a ton of those roles, so just adding the most common ones is good enough
